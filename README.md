Methods (Short Overview)Course topic used:General clustering algorithms – specifically k-means on user–item rating vectors.External method:TF–IDF features built from movie genres (genres_str) and cosine similarity for content-based movie similarity.Models:Popularity baseline: rank movies by global mean rating (with a minimum rating-count threshold).Cluster-only recommender: For each user, recommend movies with high mean rating within that user’s k-means cluster, excluding already-rated movies.Hybrid recommender:For each candidate movie ($m$):$\text{cluster\_score}(m)$ = mean rating of ($m$) inside the user’s cluster$\text{content\_score}(m)$ = maximum TF–IDF cosine similarity between ($m$) and any movie the user liked (rating ≥ 4.0) in the training setFinal score:$$\text{final\_score}(m) = 0.7 \cdot \text{cluster\_score}(m) + 0.3 \cdot \text{content\_score}(m)$$Evaluation metric:Hit-rate@10 on held-out test ratings.A user is counted as a “hit” if at least one of their test movies appears in the top-10 recommendations.
