# Data files

This project uses two external datasets:

- `ratings_small.csv` from MovieLens "latest small"
- `movies_metadata.csv` from Kaggle "The Movies Dataset"

Download them manually from the official pages:

- MovieLens: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
- Kaggle Movies Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset

Place the CSV files in this `data/` folder before running the notebook.
The raw data files are not included in the repository due to size and licensing.
